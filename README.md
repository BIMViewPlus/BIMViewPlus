Qt desktop application to browse IFC files on a PC (for now, only Windows).

BimViewPlus is a file browser:

Upon double click on an IFC file, that file is converted into an HTML5 document with embedded 3D viewer:

The html file is stored on the local file system:

From there, the converted file can be opened with any web browser.
