## Export to IFC4/HTML/glTF/glb/json

The loaded file can be exported to IFC4X3, glTF or an HTML5 document with embedded 3D viewer:

The html file is stored on the local file system:

From there, the converted file can be opened with any web browser.

Not only the geometry can be exported to HTML/glTF/glb, but also meta data for all elements can be exported to a JSON file.

## Split feature

Export to IFC4/HTML/glTF/glb/json allows to export all elements, or only selected elements. So by manual selection in the viewer, or by selection with the search feature, the model can be split into a partial model, and then exported.

## Search feature
BIMViewPlus has a powerful search feature. Any text or number in the name, entity tag, entity GUID, type or description can be searched in the entire IFC model.

From the search results, a partial model can be extracted and exported to IFC4/HTML/glTF/glb/json.
